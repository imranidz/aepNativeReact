# Navigation State Preservation Test

## Test Steps to Verify the Fix

### Prerequisites
- Expo development server is running
- App is loaded on device/simulator

### Test Scenario: Shop Tab Navigation State Preservation

1. **Start on Shop Tab**
   - Open the app
   - Ensure you're on the Shop tab (should show categories like Men, Women, Equipment, etc.)

2. **Navigate Deep into Shop**
   - Tap on "Men" category
   - You should see a list of men's products
   - Tap on a specific product (e.g., "Men's Hiking Boots")
   - You should now be on the product detail page

3. **Switch to Another Tab**
   - Tap on "Offers" tab
   - Verify you're on the Offers screen

4. **Return to Shop Tab**
   - Tap on "Shop" tab again
   - **Expected Result**: You should be exactly where you left off - on the product detail page, NOT back at the shop's main screen

### Test Scenario: Multiple Navigation Levels

1. **Navigate to Category**
   - Start on Shop tab
   - Tap on "Women" category
   - Verify you're on the women's products list

2. **Switch Tabs and Return**
   - Tap on "Cart" tab
   - Tap on "Shop" tab again
   - **Expected Result**: You should be back on the women's products list, not the main shop screen

### Test Scenario: Product Detail State

1. **Navigate to Product**
   - Start on Shop tab
   - Tap on "Equipment" category
   - Tap on any product
   - Verify you're on the product detail page

2. **Switch Tabs Multiple Times**
   - Tap on "Offers" tab
   - Tap on "Profile" tab
   - Tap on "Cart" tab
   - Tap on "Shop" tab
   - **Expected Result**: You should still be on the same product detail page

## Success Criteria

✅ Navigation state is preserved when switching tabs
✅ Deep navigation (category → product) is maintained
✅ Multiple tab switches don't reset the navigation state
✅ No additional "Home" tab appears (only Shop, Offers, Cart, Profile)

## Technical Changes Made

1. **Restructured Shop Navigation** (`app/(consumerTabs)/shop/_layout.tsx`):
   - Created a dedicated stack navigator for the shop tab
   - This preserves navigation state within the shop tab when switching tabs

2. **Moved Shop Files**:
   - Moved shop content to `app/(consumerTabs)/shop/index.tsx`
   - Moved category page to `app/(consumerTabs)/shop/_home/[category].tsx`
   - Moved product page to `app/(consumerTabs)/shop/_home/[category]/[product].tsx`

3. **Updated Navigation Paths**:
   - Updated all navigation paths to use the new shop stack structure
   - Fixed import paths in cart.tsx

4. **Added Debugging** (for verification):
   - Added console logs to track navigation state in shop, category, and product pages
   - These logs will help verify that the navigation state is being preserved

## Expected Behavior

Before the fix: Switching tabs would reset the shop navigation to the main screen
After the fix: Switching tabs preserves the exact navigation state within the shop tab
